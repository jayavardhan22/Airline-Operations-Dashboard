# ✈️ Airline Operations Dashboard

This repository contains an interactive **Airline Operations Dashboard** built using both **Tableau** and **Power BI**, designed to provide key performance insights on flight arrivals and airline operations. The dashboards visualize real-time metrics such as flight statuses, delays, terminal-specific arrivals, airline-wise breakdowns, and more.

The data used for this project was sourced from **Dubai Pulse – Dubai Airports Flight Information (Arrivals)** and cleaned prior to analysis.
